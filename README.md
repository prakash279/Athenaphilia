This is a teaching assistant project.

We did a survey to help our teachers to reduce their workload.
The survey was done in two parts:
1. Teaching a class of 26 students to understand how difficult it is to teach to all the students and keeping them engaged at the same time.
2. We built a small questionnaire for some of our teachers about their teaching methods, assesment techniques and some basic questions about what they would want from a teaching assistant.
