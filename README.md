# Athenaphilia
Project description: This project aims to reduce the workload of a secondary school teacher. We took a survey in Priyadarshani School to help us to understand about their workload.
The survey was done in two parts:
1. Teaching a class of 26 students to understand how difficult it is to teach all the students and keep them engaged simultaneously.
2. We built a small questionnaire for some of our teachers about their teaching methods and assessment techniques, and some basic questions about what they would want from a teaching assistant.

This teaching assistant's main goal is to facilitate the teaching process by helping teachers obtain thorough lesson materials and notes. It also provides an advanced system for assessing student replies to open-ended questions by using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to examine and contrast the answers with those supplied by the teacher. This review technique is significant because it minimizes bias and places a high priority on basic factual correctness, guaranteeing impartial and fair assessment procedures.
