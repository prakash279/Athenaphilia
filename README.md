Project description: This project aims to reduce the work load of a secondary school teacher. We took a survey in Priyadarshani School to help us to understand about their work load.
The survey was done in two parts:
1. Teaching a class of 26 students to understand how difficult it is to teach to all the students and keep them engaged simultaneously.
2. We built a small questionnaire for some of our teachers about their teaching methods, assessment techniques and some basic questions about what they would want from a teaching assistant.
